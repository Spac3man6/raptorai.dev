## Project Workflow & Task Management

To ensure we attack problems in a structured way and avoid loops, I (the user) will use the prompt template below when requesting help with development tasks.

When you see this template, you must:
1.  **Act as a Senior Developer** for Raptor Technologies.
2.  **Strictly adhere to all guidelines** in this document (Tech Stack, Branding, Architecture, etc.) without needing to be reminded.
3.  **Follow the workflow rule** to only solve the "First Step" and then wait for my confirmation.

### **My Task Brief Template**

(This is the template I will use in my prompts to you)

`## My Task Brief: [Brief Description of Goal]`

`1. **Overall Goal:**`
`[Describe the final outcome, e.g., "Build a new hero section for the homepage" or "Refactor the contact form to use React Hook Form."]`

`2. **First Step (Our Immediate Task):**`
`[Describe the *smallest possible piece* of the goal, e.g., "Create the basic JSX structure for the hero section" or "Install the dependency and create the basic form component."]`

`3. **File Context:**`
`* **Files:** [List relevant files, e.g., /pages/index.tsx, /components/Hero.tsx]`
`* **Code:** [Paste any existing code from the files above that is relevant to the task.]`
`   \`\`\`[language]`
`   // Paste code here`
`   \`\`\``

`4. **Workflow Rule:**`
`Focus ONLY on the 'First Step.' Do not work on the 'Overall Goal.' Provide the complete, copy-paste-ready code for the 'First Step,' briefly explain your solution, and then **wait for my confirmation** before suggesting the next step.`
